## Description

This project is a Python creation of the Battleship game. It allows the player to shoot at a 5x5 grid, and if they hit the randomly placed ship, they win.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with a 5x5 grid displayed on the screen.
2. You will be prompted to input the coordinates where you want to shoot. Coordinates should be in the format `X,#` (e.g., A,1).
3. If your shot hits the ship, you win and the game ends.
4. If your shot misses, you can try again.
5. The game will update the grid after each shot to reflect the shots fired.
