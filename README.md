## Description

This project is a Python creation of the Battleship game. It allows the player to shoot at a grid, and if they hit the randomly placed ship, they win.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with a grid of your choosing displayed on the screen.
2. You will be prompted to input the coordinates where you want to shoot.
3. Coordinates should be in the format X,# (e.g., A,1).
4. If your shot hits the ship, you win and the game ends.
5. If your shot misses, you can try again.
6. The game will update the grid after each shot to reflect the shots fired.

## [Battleship 1.0](BattleShip_Stage1.py)
Overview: Stage 1.0 focuses on creating the game board and basic functions of Battleship. A random number should be generated to represent the ship's location on the game board, and the user will be prompted to input a guess followed by the display of an updated grid.

## [Battleship 1.1](BattleShip_Stage1.1.py)
Overview: Now that the basics of Battleship have been created, this stage will challenge you to integrate some dynamic functions within the game. The user should define the size of the grid and have the ability to determine whether or not ships are placed randomly or manually.

## [Battleship 2.0](Battleship_Stage2.py)
Overview: This stage focuses on keeping track of two sets of data rather than one. Only a single ship will be utilized.





## [Battleship 2.1](BattleShip_Stage2.1.py)
Overview: This stage increases in intensity by requiring larger ships. Consequently, this also means that there is more data to be stored, and there will be two separate lists for storing data.
