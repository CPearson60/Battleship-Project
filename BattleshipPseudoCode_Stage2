two boards - player and computer

one 1x1 ship per board
player gets to choose placement for their board
computer will randomly generate for computer board

use the same user board from stage 1.1
have a duplicate of the board for the computer except:
- prompt computer to randomly generate a board with 
  min and max col and row requirements

get computer and player turns to alternate

edge cases:
- show player ship the whole time
- make it so player cannot hit their own ship
- make it so that computer cannot have their ship where
  the player's ship is; prompt player to repick ship
