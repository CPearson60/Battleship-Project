1. Computer Generates Random Point Battlegrid[Randompoint][Randompoint]
    randompoint = random.randint(1,4)
2. The Player Should Input A Cord Row(Letter), Col(Num)
3. Traverse Mock List To See If input Matches
4. If input matches a specific index in the mock list, recognize the index numnber and replace the same index number of the original list with a stored hit.
5. Verify If Hit Was Ship or Not
6. If Hit == True Show Player Won and Show Cord Ship Was On
7. If Ship Is Not hit repeat process until ship is hit

#Create method to say player cant hit same cord twice
#Edge Cases
